# CI/CD Pipeline with Git and GitHub Actions
The objective of this assignment is to get hands on with Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD), an 
automated approach to software development. Youâ€™ll set up CI/CD pipeline using the popular tools and see the benefits 
they bring to the DevOps pipeline. This will be a group assignment and each group should consist of two people only.
## Instructions
Generally, there are four types of environments in the software development process such as Development, Testing, 
Staging and Production. The Development environment, also known as Dev, is where the software develops, and all the 
updates take place at first. The software in this environment is usually updated with all changes when developers commit 
to the Dev branch. Once the developer is satisfied then he/she commits changes to the testing branch which deploys all 
updates on Testing environment for QAs to test new and changed code whether via automated or non-automated 
techniques. Thus, testers can ensure the quality of the code by finding any bugs and reviewing all bug fixes. However, if all 
tests pass, the test environment can automatically move the code to the next deployment staging environment. This 
environment is nearly the same as the production environment to ensure the software works correctly. The target here is 
to test the complete software and observe how it will look on the production server. Finally, after all tests, the changes are 
deployed to the Production environmentfor end users.
